# usedclips
a program that will automatically move all the video clips you have already used in video software into a seperate folder, making it easy for you to organize your video clips. 

if you use nvidia shadowplay or any other clipping software and have a massive folder of videos, that may or may not have been used in a video editor for final production, and you would like to remove the ones already used, this app provides the functionality required. it will move all the used files to a seperate usedclips directory in the parent directory. 

this method only works when the video clips are used in VEGAS PRO and an sfk file is produced while in editing
